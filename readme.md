# MOVED TO CODEBERG

## Migrating from GitHub to Codeberg

Many developers are shifting from GitHub to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/), a European, community-driven platform. This move is largely fueled by a desire for greater data sovereignty and a commitment to open-source ethics.
Why Developers are Leaving GitHub
- **Corporate Ownership**: Concerns over Microsoft’s influence on data privacy and potential censorship.
- **Legal Risks**: Hosting with US-based companies subjects data to American jurisdiction, specifically laws like the Patriot Act and FISA, which allow broad government surveillance and data access.
- **Performance**: Increasing reports of GitHub becoming bloated or unreliable, particularly with CI/CD tools.
- **AI Ethics**: Friction regarding GitHub Copilot and the use of open-source code for training proprietary models.

## Why Choose Codeberg?
- **Non-Profit Governance**: Operated by a European non-profit dedicated to transparency, not shareholders.
- **Legal Protections**: Benefiting from stricter European data protection regulations.
- **Seamless Transition**: Offers a familiar Gitea-based interface that minimizes the learning curve.
- **Community First**: Focuses on serving the developer community rather than monetizing user data.
